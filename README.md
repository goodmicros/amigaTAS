output pins should be driven with an open-collector to imitate the controllers switches.
This could be fixed in code, but has been left for hardware to handle in order to simplify the firmware.

# Firmware

For TAS mode, hold *FIREA* on reset. For USB joystick mode hold *FIREB* on reset.  
All joystick input is sent over serial as a single byte (active low): [0, 0, FIREB, FIREA, RIGHT, LEFT, DOWN, UP]

# Notes

### Configuration
A separate configuration button should be added in order to avoid using the reset button unnecessarily. for example hot-swapping TAS mode when playing as an USB joystick can cause problems.

### Reading inputs
Currently all input is passed through the MCU, this causes a ~100 Âµs delay. Perhaps the input should be passed through directly and have the MCU just monitor the signals and pull them down when needed.  
Also, the input should be configured in the same port so the pins can be read directly with PINn.

### Timing
Time should be indicated in frames instead of seconds. Optionally sub-frame timing could be indicated with a decimal value.  
Unfortunately arduino doesn't really seem to like interrupts and counting frames without them is unnecessarily complicated.
